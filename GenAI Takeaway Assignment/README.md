# RAG Based Job Search (Sushant Neopane)

The system is a hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that returns job listings for user queries. The RAG pipeline consists of various components such as preprocessing, embeddings, vector store, retriever, hybrid search and LLM integration coupled with thoughtful prompt design for accurate and concise LLM output. It also consists of an API endpoint, implemented using FastAPI. The main endpoint is a POST request to /api/query, designed to handle incoming queries in JSON format.

The system first extracts key details like company, location, and job level from the userâ€™s query using a simple regex parser. Then it uses hybrid search to find the best job matches by combining two methods: dense search using sentence-transformer embeddings with a FAISS index, and sparse search using BM25 for keyword matching. The results are combined based on an adjustable weight (alpha). If a Cohere API key is available, the system provides an AI-generated summary of the top results, otherwise, it uses a basic fallback template. Finally, the system delivers a short, easy-to-read summary along with relevant job IDs and metadata.
